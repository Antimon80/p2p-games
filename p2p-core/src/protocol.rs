//! Protocol primitives for the P2P games platform.
//!
//! This module defines a transport-agnostic message envelope and the
//! payload types needed for global chat, discovery (room announcements),
//! and basic room management. Messages can be serialized via `serde`
//! (e.g., JSON/CBOR) and sent over any transport (iroh gossip, TCP, â€¦).
//!
//! # Design goals
//! - **Stable envelope**: versioned header, generic `body`.
//! - **Extensible**: add new `Kind`/payload variants without breaking old peers.
//! - **Transport-agnostic**: the transport deals with bytes; (de)serialization
//!   happens at the application layer.
//!
